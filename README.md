# A simple basic-purpose makefile.
BEWARE: it works w/ multiple C source files, but only creates ONE binary file.

### How to use:
```
Create a SRC dir (/path/to/project/SRC/) and move your .c and .h files inside.
Paste the makefile file in the ROOT (/path/to/project/) of your project.
Change the binary name (_) inside the makefile (1)
```
